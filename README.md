# rp-bypass
# THIS MOD IS DISCONTINUED BUT IS NOW MERGED WITH UI UTILS (ui-utils.com).

A client-side fabric mod that allows you to bypass Mojang's required server resource pack.

---
# Mod Information:

On the multiplayer screen you will see two buttons ("RP Bypass" and "Force Deny"), turning on RP Bypass will remove the required resource pack screen that you are prompted with when you join a server with a required resource pack. Turning on Force Deny will remove the resource pack prompt screen no matter if it is required or not (as some servers still require a resource pack but do not tell the client that it is required) although Force Deny will require RP Bypass to also be on to work.

This is NOT an official mojang project.
